# **Irrigation System Î¼PiHAT <br>for RaspberryPi Zero**

The irrigation PiHAT can be used for the irrigation of small gardens/vegetable patches via soil moisture level sensing and water dispensing. It may also be used in lab environments where scientists need to hold the moisture level of the soil at a constant level.

An optional configuration, which shows the modular ability of the HAT, is to replace the moisture sensors with a float switch or humidity sensor to either fill up pools; ponds; or water tanks or to operate ventilation systems if an enclosed space reaches a maximum humidity level.

The PiHAT will allow more advanced users to continuously perform measurements or monitor the soil moisture levels by sending its input from the sensors into the main Pi GPIO header.

# Getting Started

Here's how to get started with your own Irrigation System PiHAT project!

## **Step 1:**
Clone this repository to your computer to get started by using the following command line git command:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/ryxcam002/IrrigationPiHat`<br><br>

## **Step 2:**
Change directory into the newly cloned repo using:<br>
`cd IrrigationPiHat`<br><br>

## **Step 3:**
Make sure you have the latest version of KiCAD and LTSpice installed. The download links to these open source programs can be found at:<br>
KiCAD - https://www.kicad.org/download/<br>
LTSpice - https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html<br><br>

## **Step 4:**
Go through the design files to check if all is working well. If you wish to make any changes to the design, pay particular attention to the `SchematicsV2.0`, `FinalCircuitSchematic&PCB`, and `Simulations` folders.<br><br>
- The `SchematicsV2.0` folder is where you will find each submodule KiCAD schematic design. These can be modified individually to suit your needs.<br>
- The `Simulations` folder is where the V2.0 circuits weere simulated to determine if all parameters ffor circuit components were setup correctly.<br>
- The `FinalCircuitSchematic&PCB` folder is where all the submodules have been combined to form a single schematic, ready for PCB footprint assignment and BOM generation.<br><br>

## **Step 5:**
Generate gerber files for final PCB manufacturing. To do this, open the `.kicad_pcb` file in the `FinalCircuitSchematic&PCB` folder, ensure that all components/PCB specifications are correct and generate the gerber files from there.

## **Step 6:**
Manufacture PCB and solder all components or have this done by the manufacturer if they support this. You now have a micro irrrigation controller!
