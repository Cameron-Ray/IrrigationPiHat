# Manufacturing How-to Guide

### Step 1

Open by the PCB design for the main circuit. The file can be found here:

### Step 2

In PCB View, go to Files -> Plot -> Gerber Files

### Step 3

Leave the defualt slected layers and press 'Plot'. This will generate the gerber files needed for manufacturing.

### Step 4

In PCB View, go to Files -> Fabrication Outputs -> Drill File

### Step 5

Leave the default selections and press 'Generate Drill Fil'e. This will generate the drill files needed for manufacturing.

### Step 6

In PCB View, go to Files -> Fabrication Outputs -> BOM File

### Step 7

Press 'Save'. This will generate the bill of materials files needed for manufacturing.

Alternativly, the bill of materials file can be found here:

### Step 8

In PCB View, go to Files -> Fabrication Outputs -> Footprint Position Files

### Step 9

Leave the default selections and press 'Generate Position File'. This will generate the footprint position files needed for manufacturing.

### Step 10

Send all of these files to your manufacturer of choice for manufacturing.
