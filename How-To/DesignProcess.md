# How To

Read the sections below for common 'How To...' questions when assembling or using the circuit.

## Power Module

## Amplifier Module

### Required Hardware:

- 2 x Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensors
- 1 x microPiHat

### Step 1

Make sure that the power module has been connected properly.

### Step 2

Familiarise yourself with the front face of the microPiHat PCB below.

### Step 3

Connect your first capacitive soil moisture sensor to connector J1 on the microPiHat PCB.

### Step 4

Connect your second capacitive soil moisture sensor to connector J3 on the microPiHat PCB.

### Step 5 (optional)

If you want to use the output signal that ranges from 0V - 3.3V from the amplification stage for the first soil moisture sensor, connect to connector J2 on the microPiHat PCB.

### Step 6 (optional)

If you want to use the output signal that ranges from 0V - 3.3V from the amplification stage for the second soil moisture sensor, connect to connector J6 on the microPiHat PCB.

## LED Module

### Required Hardware:

- 1 x microPiHat

### Step 1

Make sure that the power module has been connected properly.

### Step 2

Make sure that the amplification module has been connected properly with both soil moisture sensors. If only a single soil moisture sesnor has been connected, then only a single LED indicator will work.
